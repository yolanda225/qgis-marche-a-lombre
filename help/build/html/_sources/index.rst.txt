Overview
--------

**Marche à l'ombre** calculates the shady and sunny portions of a given hiking trail in France, using time of departure, the calculated solar positions per trail point and terrain/surface elevation data

The plugin uses:

* IGN LiDAR HD elevation data (MNS/MNT)
* Sun position calculations based on datetime and location

Features
--------

* Dynamic layer retrieval from IGNs Web Map Service (https://data.geopf.fr/wms*r?SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.3.0&REQUEST=GetCapabilities)
* Adjustable hiking speed and picnic break
* Reversal of trail
* Buffered calculation (calculation also 5m to the right and left of the trail to )
* Vector output with color-coded trail segments
* Statistics output (percentage sunny, etc.)

Requirements
------------

* QGIS 3.0 or later
* Internet connection (to download elevation data from IGN)
* Python dependencies (included in QGIS):
  
  * numpy
  * gdal
* Python dependencies (optional and not included in QGIS):
  * pvlib (If not installed, a manual solar position calculation is used)

Installation
------------

From QGIS Plugin Repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Open QGIS
2. Go to **Plugins → Manage and Install Plugins**
3. Search for "Marche à l'ombre"
4. Click **Install**

Manual Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Download repository (https://github.com/yolanda225/qgis-marche-a-lombre)
2. Compress to ZIP-file
3. Open QGIS and go to **Plugins → Manage and Install Plugins**
4. Select **Install from ZIP**

Usage
-----

Basic Workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Dowload a GPX hiking trail (e.g. from Visorando)
2. Load the GPX layer in QGIS
3. Configure parameters:
   
   * **Input layer**: GPX tracks layer
   * **Departure Date and Time**: When you start hiking
   * **Hiking Speed**: Your average speed (km/h)
   * **Picnic Point** (optional): Location for a break
   * **Reverse Direction**: Reverse direction of the trail

4. Click **Run**

Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~

**Input layer**
  Vector line layer representing your hiking trail (**tracks**)

**Departure Date and Time**
  The date and time when you start your hike (Local Time): used to calculate solar position throughout the trail

**Average Hiking Speed (km/h)**
  Your expected hiking speed (default: 5.0 km/h)

**Picnic Break Location** (optional)
  Click on the map to set a break point (button to the right of the input box)

**Picnic Duration (minutes)** (optional)
  How long your break will last (default: 60 minutes)

**Reverse Trail Direction**
  Walk from finish to start instead of start to finish

**Calculate with Buffer**
  Calculate for center, left 5m, and right 5m of trail to visualize shadow next to trail

Outputs
~~~~~~~

The plugin generates:

* **MNS**: High-resolution surface model around trail
* **Low Resolution MNS**: Larger surface model for long shadows
* **Densified Trail Points**: Color-coded points showing sun/shadow status
  
  * 🟡 Gold arrows = Sun
  * 🔵 Blue arrows = Shadow

* **Statistics Table (CSV)**: Summary of time in sun vs shadow

Interpretation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each point along your trail is classified as either in **sun** or **shadow** based on:

* The sun's position at the time you reach that point
* The surrounding terrain (mountains, hills, trees)
* Your hiking speed and any breaks

The statistics show what percentage of your hike will be in shade vs. sun.

Coverage
--------

Works for trails in:

* France Métropole
* Guadeloupe
* Réunion
* Support for possible future IGN elevation data of Overseas France

Troubleshooting
---------------

**Bad request /Failed to dowload data**
  Might be an issue on the servers side, try again.

**"No candidates found" error**
  Your trail may be outside supported regions (France and French territories).

**Very slow processing**
  Long trails require significant computation. Consider splitting your trail into segments.
